        Thanks for contributing to [VM-Packages](https://github.com/mandiant/VM-Packages), your package proposal supports tools available for [FLARE-VM](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm) and [CommandoVM](https://github.com/mandiant/commando-vm)! :cupid: Please ensure that your suggested tool doesn't already exist within the set of [current packages](https://github.com/mandiant/VM-Packages/tree/main/packages) and that there is no [issue](https://github.com/mandiant/VM-Packages/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%3Anew%3A+package%22) proposal already. If the tool is not related malware analysis, incident response, penetration testing and other security related tasking, consider using directly the [Chocolatey community package](https://community.chocolatey.org/packages).

        The convention is to use lowercase names with the following format: `toolname` or `tool-name` and without `.vm` appended. Example: `capa` and `fakenet-ng`. **Please add this name to the issue title as well** (keep the `.vm` in the title)
