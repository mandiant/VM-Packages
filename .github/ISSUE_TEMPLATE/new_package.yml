        Thanks for contributing to [VM-Packages](https://github.com/mandiant/VM-Packages), your package proposal supports tools available for [FLARE-VM](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm)! :cupid: Please ensure that your suggested tool doesn't already exist within the set of [current packages](https://github.com/mandiant/VM-Packages/tree/main/packages) and that there is no [issue](https://github.com/mandiant/VM-Packages/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%3Anew%3A+package%22) proposal already.
        ### Use the package name as the issue title.
        The convention is to use lowercase names with the following format: `toolname.vm` or `tool-name.vm`. For example `capa.vm` and `fakenet-ng.vm`.
