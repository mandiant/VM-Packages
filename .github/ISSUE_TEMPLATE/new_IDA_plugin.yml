        Thanks for contributing to [VM-Packages](https://github.com/mandiant/VM-Packages), your package proposal supports IDA plugins available for [FLARE-VM](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm)! :cupid: Please ensure that your suggested IDA plugin doesn't already exist within the set of [current packages](https://github.com/mandiant/VM-Packages/tree/main/packages) and that there is no [issue](https://github.com/mandiant/VM-Packages/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%3Anew%3A+package%22) proposal already.

        The convention is to use lowercase names with the following format: `pluginname` or `plugin-name`, with `ida.plugin.` prepended and without the `.vm` appended. Example: `ida.plugin.capa` and `ida.plugin.sigmaker`. **Please add this name to the issue title as well** (keep the `.vm` in the title).

        - **`IDA_PLUGIN`** - IDA plugin distributed as a single file or ZIP containing a plugin (and supporting files/directories) that need to be copied to the IDA plugins directory. For ZIPs, we check if there is an inner folder (this is the case for GH ZIPs) and if there is a directory called `plugins`. We copy all files in this directory (the root directory, the inner folder or the `plugins` directory depending what is present) with the exception of the README and the LICENSE file (often present in GH repos). The copied files must include the file `plugin name` specified below.
        - **`OTHER/UNKNOWN`** - An IDA plugin distributed in a different way than `IDA_PLUGIN`. It is required that you provide details of how the plugin is installed in the `Extra information` section. Note this type does not support automation, a PR would be appreciated!
